What's new?
================

Version 2.0.0
--------------

Python version changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python version 3.7 has been dropped. Jishaku 2.0 requires Python 3.8 or greater.

New commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``jsk rtt``
    Calculates the round-trip time between your bot and the Discord API.
    Reports exact values as well as an average and standard deviation.

- ``jsk dis``
    Disassembles a given piece of Python code in REPL context, returning the bytecode.
    This does not actually execute the code, but can be used to identify compiler behavior and optimizations.

- ``jsk permtrace``
    Calculates the effect of permissions and overwrites on a given member or set of roles in a channel.
    This can be used to identify why a member does, or does not, have a permission in a given place.

Command improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``jsk``
    Information on sharding status for both automatically and manually sharded bots is now displayed.

    The root 'jsk' command can now be sanely overridden, removed, or renamed using the Feature system.

- ``jsk py`` / ``jsk pyi``
    Exceptions now display the line from which they originate, instead of just the line number.

    Large results that fit within the Discord preview threshold are now uploaded as files,
    for better navigability.

- ``jsk sh``
    Timeout has been increased from 90 seconds from invocation, to 120 seconds from the last output.

    This should reduce the chance of termination from long-running installs or other processes.

- ``jsk source``
    Triple backticks inside of source files no longer cause the file content to spill outside of its codeblock.

    Large results that fit within the Discord preview threshold are now uploaded as files,
    for better navigability.

- ``jsk vc``
    Voice commands no longer appear if their relevant dependencies are not installed.

- ``jsk shutdown``
    Now uses ``bot.close`` to prevent deprecation warnings.

    Fixed a regression with braille J support.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Feature system
    The Feature system has been implemented as a means to solve subclassing problems with Jishaku.

    Certain functionality can now be disabled in subclasses, additional commands can be easily facilitated
    without affecting the native Jishaku cog, and overriding subcommands or groups is now possible without
    needing to reimplement commands that would otherwise become orphaned in the process.

- PaginatorInterface
    Updating mechanism has been entirely rewritten to better prevent cascades of message edits.

    This change has also made it possible to synchronously trigger interface updates, paving the way for
    possible native stream or TextIO support in the future.
